            <h1>About me</h1>
            <ol>
            <li>Hi my name is Janty Sphabmixay and this is my first year in college. I had just graduated from Mt. Carmel High School in June 2016</li>
                <li>I am taking WEBD 162 because I enjoy coding websites and I need this class for my major(s).
		    I am planning on majoring in Business Market, Business Management, Web Development, and Computer Science.</li>
            <li>The other classes that I'm taking this semester besides WEBD 162 are ENG 101, MATH 141, ECON 120, MULT 121 and WEBD 165 (6 Classes total)
            <li>Something I really enjoy doing is traveling. I've been to all the States in the United States besides Hawaii and Alaska
			and am currently planning a trip to go and visit Laos! 
			<br>
			Another thing I really enjoy doing just like any other girl is shopping and reading books! My favorite book so far is It's Kind of a Funny Story by Ned Vizzini! </li>
